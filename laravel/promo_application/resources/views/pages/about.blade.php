            <p>Drifting off for a peaceful night in the land of Nod isn’t always as sin-loo as we’d like it to be.
                There’s
                nothing more frustrating than feeling exhausted yet the moment your head hits the pillow, thoughts about
                everything you didn’t have time to do that day arrive eager for attention. Sleep Orbit’s relaxing
                collection
                of sounds might just be the perfect alternative to that chatty mind.
                <br><br>
                The app is loaded with categories of sounds, from standard ones like Ocean (there’s Gentle Waves, Deep
                Ocean
                Bubbles or Calm) to more niche ones like Haircut (listen to Scissors or even Blow Dryer), if that’s your
                thing. From the Background Noise section, you’ve got options for bustling sounds like Coffee Shop or go
                for
                something a little more domesticated in the form of Washing Machine or Clothes Dryer. More sound bundles
                are
                available through in-app purchases including City Life and Nature.
                You can mix and match sounds too, perhaps pairing Rolling Thunder with Birds for a relaxing nature
                theme;
                all your mixes will be saved under My Mixes where you can name them and then choose what you want to
                hear
                depending on your mood. The sounds you select will revolve around an icon for a head on the app screen;
                dragging the icon for each sound outwards pushes the sound furtl…., away vv MT.-loving it.

                opposite. When listening with headphones, placing the icon on the right side makes the sound come from
                the
                right, and placing it on the left side makes the sound come from the left.</p>
